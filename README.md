# Converts USB Webcam into Smart Security Camera

## Dependencies:
Python 2.7.x
OpenCV 3.4.x

## Installing Dependences:
The default pip version of OpenCV does not contain the required video capabilities.
This requires the install to be compiled with ffmpeg, which can be accomplished by installing from source or using precompiled pip channel (below):  
```
$ conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
$ conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```
